# To-Do-List
## App Link: https://ancient-sierra-17654.herokuapp.com/
Built a personal To-Do list website using HTML, jQuery, and Node.js. 
Removed redundancy by using EJS to create a common, reusable template that generates different HTML pages for different custom to-do lists.
Routed different application endpoints to corresponding clientsâ€™ requests using Express and the HTTPs module.
Persisted application data using Mongoose and MongoDB Atlas.
Deployed the web app to the WWW using Heroku.
